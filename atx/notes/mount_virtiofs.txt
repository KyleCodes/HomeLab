One time mounting ex:
  - sudo mount -t virtiofs Movies /home/your-username/Videos/Movies

Replace /home/your-username/Videos/Movies with your desired mount point. Ensure the directory exists before running the command:

```
mkdir -p /home/your-username/Videos/Movies
```

If this works, you will see the contents of /mnt/user/Movies from the Unraid host accessible at /home/your-username/Videos/Movies in your VM.

^ good to actually mount this in a semantically correct place, such as /mnt/Movies


FINAL SOLUTION:


```
# /etc/fstab
# verify this change works by running `sudo mount -a`


Movies /mnt/shares/Movies virtiofs defaults 0 0
TV /mnt/shares/TV virtiofs defaults 0 0
```
